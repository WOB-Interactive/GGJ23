Sharing Is Caring (Sponsored by GitHub): Share the source code for your submission in a public GitHub repository and list the URL on your submission page.

Caption Contest: 2023 is the 30th anniversary of subtitling in games. Your game has text equivalents for both speech and important sounds.

## Design Elements to consider

Proximity Effect: Make all of your game music using only objects that are in close environment (for example, tapping pen on table to create a beat, etc).

An Image Is Worth 1,000 Words: Make a game that has no text. ( Option to remove Closed Caption)

A Friend In Need: Implement a character that aids you in your goal in the game. 


## Story
- Land in New Planet Looking for resources.
- Empathetic Insect Companion Friend ( Detect TapRoots, Detect Enemy Sound)
- Reptilians Fear the unknown
- Reptilian hive mind. 
- Being found by a Reptile causes end of game. (Hide and Seek)
- Need collection of baby roots to re-vegitate your world
 - Edible Taproots Found on Earth: Carrots, radishes, turnips, beets. ( Different root = different ability)

## Art Style 
- PS1 Graphics
- Lizards, Snakes, Gecko, Eggs, Incubation area, 
- Underground, Cave Dungeon, Land Area, The Hunted Woods ( Skeletons of humans, reptiles, animals) (OP FIGHT IF we introduce violence).
- Pretty Gems! (Points / Collectable track) [Facts: Diamonds are the only gems of carbon. Sapphires and rubies are corundum, aluminum oxide. Emeralds are beryl. Herkimer diamonds are quartz, silicon dioxide.] Chemical compound is importance of this note we want.
